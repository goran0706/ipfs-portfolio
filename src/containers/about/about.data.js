			description: `A junior blockchain developer with prior experience developing web and blockchain apps who feels he possesses the technical abilities required to develop secure blockchain applications. Having a decent understanding of Solidity and expertise designing secure Smart Contracts that operate on the Ethereum blockchain and have the specific benefit of being immune to fraud, downtime, third-party intervention, and censorship. By leveraging the most recent cryptographic techniques, best practices, and smart contract patterns to improve the cybersecurity of the decentralized applications. Quality assurance, audits, and the full process of planning, creating, testing, deploying, and updating smart contracts were all part of my responsibilities. Optimizing and safeguarding blockchain applications via the incorporation of new tools and technologies, as well as documenting blockchain development processes and adhering to data protection best practices.`,

			title: 'Web 3.0 Developer',
			description: `A Blockchain developer performs a variety of tasks, including writing smart contracts, which are Blockchain-based programs that execute on nodes. I have created and implemented application interfaces and features in line with Blockchain demands using the appropriate programming languages as a Junior Blockchain Developer. I've worked with Web3 technologies for the past two years. Web3 concept allows applications and other digital products to operate on Blockchain. Experienced working on small and large, decentralized and open-source initiatives, including building applications on the InterPlanetary File System - IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, apps, and data. It is also used to develop decentralized applications, making it more difficult to restrict content and speeding up the web by retrieving data from the nearest nodes.
