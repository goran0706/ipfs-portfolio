			title: 'Web 3.0 Developer',
			description: `Among many roles, a Blockchain developer writes smart contracts, which are programs developed for the Blockchain that runs on the Blockchain nodes.
			As a Junior Blockchain Developer i have built and implemented application interfaces and features in accordance with Blockchain needs using the corresponding programming languages. Applications that leverage Blockchain technology run a slightly different, decentralized version on the internet called Web3. The decentralized application must correspond to the Web3 standards. Experienced with working on large decentralized and open-source projects. Experienced with building applications on the InterPlanetary File System - IPFS that is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data, which is also used to build decentralized applications, making it harder to censor content and speed up the web by fetching data from closest nodes.
